Exercise Guide) of the store with the highest msa_income and the store
with the lowest median msa_income (according to the msa_income field).
In what city and state were these two stores, and which store had a higher
average daily revenue?

8. Divide the msa_income groups up so that msa_incomes between 1 and
20,000 are labeled 'low', msa_incomes between 20,001 and 30,000 are
labeled 'med-low', msa_incomes between 30,001 and 40,000 are labeled
'med-high', and msa_incomes between 40,001 and 60,000 are labeled

13  For each store, determine the month with the minimum average daily
revenue (as I define it in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) . For each of the
twelve months of the year, count how many stores' minimum average
daily revenue was in that month. During which month(s) did over 100
stores have their minimum average daily revenue?
