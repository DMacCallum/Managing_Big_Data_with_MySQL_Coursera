1.How many distinct dates are there in the saledate column of the transaction
table for each month/year combination in the database?

------
SELECT EXTRACT(Month FROM saledate) AS month_num, EXTRACT(Year FROM saledate)
AS year_num, COUNT(DISTINCT saledate) AS date_ct
FROM TRNSACT
GROUP BY month_num, year_num
ORDER BY month_num


2.Use a CASE statement within an aggregate function to determine which sku
had the greatest total sales during the combined summer months of June, July, and August.

------
SELECT sku, SUM(Jun_sale+July_sale+Aug_sale) AS total_sale
FROM
(SELECT sku, 
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate) = 6 THEN quantity END)  AS Jun_sale,
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate) = 7 THEN quantity END) AS July_sale,
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM saledate) = 8 THEN quantity END) AS Aug_sale
FROM TRNSACT
WHERE stype = 'P'
GROUP BY sku) AS c

GROUP BY sku
ORDER BY total_sale DESC

3. How many distinct dates are there in the saledate column of the transaction
table for each month/year/store combination in the database? Sort your results by the
number of days per combination in ascending order.

FROM TRNSACT
GROUP BY store, month_num, year_num
ORDER BY sd_ct DESC


4.What is the average daily revenue for each store/month/year combination in
the database? Calculate this by dividing the total revenue for a group by the number of
sales days available in the transaction table for that group.

FROM TRNSACT
WHERE stype = 'P' AND NOT (EXTRACT(Month FROM saledate) = 8 AND EXTRACT(Year FROM saledate) = 2005)
GROUP BY store, month_year
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT saledate)>=20
ORDER BY daily_rev DESC;
